    Given a schedule containing the arrival and departure time of trains in a station, find the minimum number of platforms needed to avoid delay in any trainâ€™s arrival.

    Input:

    arrival = [2.00, 2.10, 3.00, 3.20, 3.50, 5.00]
    departure = [2.30, 3.40, 3.20, 4.30, 4.00, 5.20]

    Output: 2

    Explanation: The minimum platforms needed is 2

    The train arrived at 2.00 on platform 1
    The train arrived at 2.10 on platform 2
    The train departed at 2.30 from platform 1
    The train arrived at 3.00 on platform 1
    The train departed at 3.20 from platform 1
    The train arrived at 3.20 on platform 1
    The train departed at 3.40 from platform 2
    The train arrived at 3.50 on platform 2
    The train departed at 4.00 from platform 2
    The train departed at 4.30 from platform 1
    The train arrived at 5.00 on platform 1
    The train departed at 5.20 from platform 1
