    /*

    Given a given sequence, find the length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) in it.

    The longest decreasing subsequence is a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, highest to lowest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.

    Input : [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The longest decreasing subsequence is [12, 10, 9, 5, 3] having length 5; the input sequence has no 6â€“member decreasing subsequences.

    The longest decreasing subsequence is not necessarily unique. For instance, [12, 10, 6, 5, 3] is another decreasing subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence.
